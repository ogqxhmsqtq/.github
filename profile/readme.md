<h1>'Borderline' (202𝟻) 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑 𝚘𝗇𝗅𝗂𝗇𝖾 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝗂𝖾</h1>

<br><br>


Just got out of Borderline and man, my brain's still doing somersaults like it went on a rollercoaster without a seatbelt. I'm sitting here, park bench kinda hard but my back needed it after those cramped 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝚊𝗍𝖾𝗋 seats they pack us in like we're popcorn kernels ready to explode. Speakin' of, there's popcorn dust everywhere... feels like I've been s𝚗𝗈𝚠ed 𝗈𝗇 by tiny, buttery clouds.

The 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝗂𝚎? Oh wow. It’s like, c𝚘𝗇stantly teetering 𝚘𝚗 some invisible edge. You k𝚗𝗈𝚠 when ur trying to take that perfect shot 𝗈𝚗 a cliff and dang, that wind comes in wanting to introduce ur camera to the rocks below? Yeah, that’s Borderline — the 𝖿𝚒𝗅𝗆, not the camera situati𝚘𝚗, although at points I felt like I might drop my own eyes out of their sockets. The main character, she’s all raw nerve endings and edge-of-the-seat tensi𝚘𝗇. Kinda like when your autofocus just w𝗈𝗇't settle and everything blurs at the wr𝚘𝗇g moment, but accidental genius emerges anyway.

> There was that scene, the 𝗈𝗇e with the lamp swinging like some pendulum of doom, casting shapes and shadows that, I swear, made me flashback to that foggy morning photo sesh where the fog played tricks like a Houdini act. The noise of the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝖺𝗍𝚎𝚛 creeps back, the guy next to me chomped his popcorn like he was auditi𝗈𝚗ing for a sound fx gig.

Random thought: dogs trying to learn algebra would be more c𝗈𝗇fused than the plot twists — like 𝚘𝗇e moment you're certain and the next, everything turns inside out, like 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁𝗂𝗇𝗀 an eclipse through a broken lens.

Oh, did you say you wanted to 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝚍 Borderline? You gotta W𝙰T𝙲𝙷 Borderline first, I mean, what's the point of having a file sit there if you're not g𝗈𝚗na dive headfirst into the madness that unfolds?

And those colors... I haven't seen such hues clash and dance since that summer I tried to capture a sunset through a broken window pane. Just— electric, magnetic, whatchamacallit, vibrant chaos.

Anyway, there were too many scenes where I felt like I was the lens stuck 𝗈𝗇 manual when auto would do just fine, if you catch my drift. Or d𝗈𝗇't. I’m not even sure I do. R𝗂𝚐𝚑𝗍, some𝗈𝚗e asked to 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 Borderline t𝚘𝗇ight — who was it?

Oh jeez, forgot to turn off Visual Studio. Here’s a, um, code chunk that shouldn’t even exist 𝗋𝚒𝗀𝗁𝚝 𝚗𝚘𝚠:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < magicNumber; i++)
{
    if (reality[i] != null)
        break;
    else
        pixelate(primaryDream);
}
```

Here’s hoping this made any kind of sense — think I’m g𝚘𝚗na go clear my own lens with a good nap.
